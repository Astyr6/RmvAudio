# RmvAudio
Remove the audio of any MP4 file just by dropping it on the EXE!

RmvAudio is very easy to use, just drop any `.mp4` file on `RmvAudio.exe` and any sound will automatically be deleted.

## Installation
It is recommended to have a shorcut to the EXE file on your desktop, because yes, if you drop a file on a shotcut leading to the EXE file, this will also work!
